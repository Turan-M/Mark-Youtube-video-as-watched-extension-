# Mark YouTube Videos as Watched Extension

## Overview
This extension automatically enhances your YouTube experience by allowing you to manually mark videos as watched. An easy-to-use tool, it keeps your video feed clutter-free and helps you keep track of which ones you have seen with an easy, visible indicator.

## Compatibility
The extension is developed for browsers based on the Chromium engine, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Brave. It is not compatible with non-Chromium browsers and may not function as intended if attempted to be used elsewhere.

## Installation
To install the extension, clone or download the repository from GitHub, and load it into your Chromium-based browser as an unpacked extension. Navigate to your browser's extension page (chrome://extensions/ for Chrome) and enable 'Developer mode'. Click 'Load unpacked' and select the extension's directory.

## Usage
Once installed, the extension will add a visual indicator on YouTube videos that you have marked as watched. To mark a video, simply click on the indicator button that appears. To unmark a video, click the button again. Your custom watched status will sync across sessions, as long as you're using the same browser profile.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the extension or tailor it to your needs, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
